    "SVM's are still effective in high-dimensional spaces. 48 features isn't really high-dimensional but compared to the size of the training set it is. SVM's are memory-efficient, although for a training set of this size that's not really an issue. Most importantly I think is that SVM's are flexible. Even though there is a risk of overfitting, this can be mitigated by tuning the `C` and `gamma` parameters. Choosing a different kernel may also improve results. I'm not sure yet what kernel would be best for this problem based on the data.\n",

    "Most notable in the results is the F1 score of the random forest algorithm on the training set compared to the test set. This indicates that the random forest overfits on the training set. I do not have a good explanation for this. The default for `max_features` is `sqrt(48)` so there should be quite some randomization over the feature space. I tried with a larger number of trees (100 and 1000) but that only increases the F1 score on the training set to `1.0000` without improving on the test set. This is the main reason for not choosing the random forest. There is probably a good reason the random forest overfits but I'm not sure what it is.\n",
